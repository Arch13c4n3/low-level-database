# low-level-database DOCUMENTATION

## version [unusuable]::[0.01].. NULL release.. ##

'classed_data' header file.
: header file contains functions that simulate the higher concepts of meta data into the low level capacities of c.
- using structs to clear some layers of abstraction in regards to data types used.
- structs are then used to create functions such as 'Data_Struct','Data_set' etc. and initialize datasets for example 'Data_set personInfo;' for creating an insatance of a dataset,
  which can then be used as the precursor for the type data_feed (to feed into the dataset).
  furthermore, datasets can also contain the setArch_id ( Set Architecture ID ) used in the api to store existing local structures and it's Architecture info.

  Key concepts:
  - SetArch_id ( Set Architecture ID ) : the unique identifier of a local or public structure used in classifying the structure's information and architecture.
                                         also used in encryption, hashing and access handling.
    :Uniqueness: An ID generator helps ensure that each instance of a data structure or architecture has a unique identifier. This uniqueness is crucial for distinguishing between different data structures or records.
		:Classification: The generated ID can serve as a classification or categorization mechanism. For example, if you have different types of data structures (e.g., lists, tables, nodes), the ID can include information about the type of architecture, making it easier to identify and manage.
		:Avoiding Conflicts: If your project involves multiple instances or multiple users creating data structures, having a unique ID helps avoid conflicts. Users can create and manage their data structures without worrying about ID clashes.
		:Reference and Retrieval: The ID can be used as a reference or key for retrieving specific data structures or records. This makes it easy to locate and manipulate the desired information in your database.
    :Consistency: Using a consistent format for IDs can enhance the overall consistency of your database. It provides a standardized way of representing and working with data structures, which can be beneficial for maintenance and future development.
    :Scalability: As your database grows, having unique IDs becomes increasingly important. An ID generator designed to handle a large number of unique IDs ensures scalability and avoids potential issues related to ID collisions.
    :Data Integrity: Unique and well-structured IDs contribute to data integrity. It helps prevent errors or inconsistencies that might arise if multiple data structures were mistakenly identified or accessed.
